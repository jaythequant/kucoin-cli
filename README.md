### A data science focused Python API implementation

#### Why use this library over [python-kucoin](https://github.com/sammchardy/python-kucoin) or the [official SDK](https://github.com/Kucoin/kucoin-python-sdk)?
Both the official SDK and Samm Chardy's API implementation are stable, well-written packages with the majority of API endpoints included. Unfortunately, the SDK is fairly bare-bones without detailed error handling, out-of-the-box function features. 

Disclaimer: This is an unofficial implementation of the [KuCoin Rest and Websocket API v2](https://docs.kucoin.com/#general). Use this package at your own risk.

#### Why [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/)? 
The KuCoin exchange is primarily appealing to users due to:
- Extremely low transactions fees (0.10% at its highest level fee schedule)
- High liquidity across coins and a wide offering shitcoins for speculation
- Frequent additions of highly speculative coins earlier than other exchanges
- Among the least regulated exchanges available. For U.S. based customers this is one of the last remaining non-KYC, derivative offering, truly chaotic exchanges available to customers
